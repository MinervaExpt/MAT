# A template for a <package>Config.cmake that can be found by using
# the find_package macro.  This should be modified to import all of
# the dependencies required by the local package.  The template is
# fairly generic, except for the "find_package" related code between
# the beginning and ending boiler plate.
#
# This expect that any targets that are being exported will be
# installed using a command like
#
# install(TARGETS myTarget
#         EXPORT <project>Targets
#          etc)
#
# Note that the <project> is set in the project(<name> <version>) macro
# that should be at the start of your top level CMakeLists.txt

#No dependencies so far.  Let's try to keep it that way!
