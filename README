Directory Structure:
  - PlotUtils - Macros and classes to help with ROOT analysis and plotting.
                If you want to include the file from another package, you should put it here.
  - setup     - files used for setting up to use PlotUtils
                contains files starting with '.', so use 'ls -a' to see them.
  - macros    - Useful or illustrative macros using PlotUtils.  You may need to source the setup script for another package for them to work.


Setup:
  - build like normal
        cd cmt
        cmt config
        source setup.sh
        cmt make
  - copy .rootlogon and .rootrc to ~
      .rootlogon loads the libplotutils.so and puts PlotUtils in the include path.
       it also includes suggested default style
  - Work from whatever package you like.  Just add "use PlotUtils v* Ana" to the cmt/requirements file.

Standalone with root6:

- copy 
cp setup/.rootlogon.C ~
cp setup/.rootrc ~

.rootlogon loads the libplotutils.so and puts PlotUtils in the include path.
it also includes suggested default style

On a mac you can build standalone as

In top PlotUtils directory

cmake build
make

# needed for PlotUtils to work standalone
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PLOTUTILSROOT}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export DY_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} # need this on recent mac OS
export PYTHONPATH=${PLOTUTILSROOT}/python:${PYTHONPATH}
export PLOTUTILSTYPE="STANDALONE"
export PLOTUTILSVERSION="ROOT6"
export BOOSTDIR= location of Boost
make -f OSXMakefile
