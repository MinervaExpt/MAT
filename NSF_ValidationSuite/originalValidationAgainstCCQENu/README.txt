compareToReferenceHists_originalValidationAgainstCCQENu.py is a special case of compareToReferenceHists.py which was used specifically to validation the implementation of systematics in the NSF framework against those in the CCQENu framework. The standard compareToReferenceHists.py tool doesn't distinguish between MnvLatErrorBands and MnvVertErrorBands, because it's intended to make comparisons between histograms all produced within the NSF, which doesn't use MnvLatErrorBands... But this would be the correct starting point for an analyzer trying to validate a different non-NSF analysis against the NSF.
